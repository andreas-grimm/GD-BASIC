This document contains the documentation of the different concepts used for the implementation of the 
interprester. It duplicates in some areas the language documentation, 
which cannot be avoided.

# Developer Documentation

This documentation has been written as a notebook or scrapbook of the
developer(s) of the interpreter - mainly to document the ideas and concepts
used in the implementation. It is a living document, under version control,
and should be extended as the code growths and needs some additional documentation.

## Markdown
All documentation is written using the MarkDown format. The documentation of the
format can be found here: [www.markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/),
 with the extended syntax documented here [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/),
or here: [github.com](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
